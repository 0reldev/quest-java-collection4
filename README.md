# Quest "Collection 04: Map"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

This is an exercice to introduce the <code>Map</code> Java interface.

It teaches how to use the <code>HashMap</code>, <code>LinkedHashMap</code> and <code>TreeMap</code> classes.

Instances of heroes from the <code>Hero</code> class are created, the Avengers.

The purpose is to associate flowers to each Hero with `Map`, and:
- display wether the instance `begonia` is contained into the TreeMap `party`
- browse the associative array in alphabetical order of hero names, and display, for each of them, its assigned flower
